# Chalk

**Dark sidebar, pastel KPI tiles** · 다크 사이드바와 파스텔 KPI 카드

A dashboard style from Vizney Styles. A charcoal chalkboard frame with soft chalk-pastel cards on a clean white canvas. Calm, friendly and quick to scan: the pastels color the tiles, while the data marks stay thin and dark.

## Layout

- App shell: dark sidebar (232px) beside a white main area (max 1320px, 36px side padding).
- Header row: page title (22px bold) on the left; search and notification icons, a KO/EN segmented toggle and the avatar on the right.
- One row of filter pills under the title. They scope every card below; cards never carry their own filters.
- Section label row: section name on the left, period note ("Last 30 days · vs. previous 30 days") on the right.
- Row 1: four KPI tiles of equal width, 16px gap.
- Row 2: the main chart card (2fr) next to a side card (1fr, min 320px).
- Below 1180px the tiles go 2 × 2 and the chart cards stack. Below 860px the sidebar becomes a top bar with a menu button.

- Categories: up to three hues, `#5EA6DA`, `#478F35`, `#F39D52`, plus gray `#8C8C8C` for "other".

Pastels are for tile backgrounds only, never for marks or text.


## Type

- Spoqa Han Sans Neo: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/spoqa/spoqa-han-sans@v3.3.0/css/SpoqaHanSansNeo.css`
- Body 13px. Card titles 15px bold with a 13px muted subtitle. KPI values 28px bold. The value in the gauge center 30px bold.
- Units and suffixes (억, 건, 원, %, M, ₩) sit next to the number at 13px bold.
- A KPI tile uses two sizes only: the value and everything else. Weight and color do the rest.
- `tabular-nums` only where numbers line up: axis ticks, tooltip and legend values.


## Components

- **KPI tile:** 12px radius, 18 × 20px padding, no border. Outline icon (20px) top left. Value on its own line, the delta chip on the line below, label underneath, in every tile, so the values line up across the row at any width. The delta chip is white with a 6px radius; its arrow is green or red by direction × whether up is good, and its text stays ink.
- **Chart card:** white, 1px border, 12px radius, 20 × 22px padding.
- **Line chart:** 2px monotone curves, 1px solid gridlines, hollow end markers (4.5px radius) on the main series. Focus pinned at the peak with a 1px ink crosshair; a dark tooltip (`#232323`, 8px radius) lists every series with line keys.
- **Gauge donut:** 270° arc, 20px stroke, 3° gaps between segments, round caps on the two outer ends only. The center shows a label over the total; hovering a segment or legend item switches it to that category's share.
- **Legend:** 11px dot, bold name, muted value and share, in a two-column grid.
- **Icons:** outline, 1.8px stroke, round caps.


## Motion and interaction

- Changing a filter fades the KPI values (140ms) and tweens lines and arcs (480ms, ease-out).
- Every chart has a hover tooltip; arrow keys move the line chart's focus. Motion is off under `prefers-reduced-motion`.


## Don'ts

- No card inside a card.
- No gradients or shadows on cards; only tooltips cast a shadow.
- No more than three colored categories; fold the rest into gray "other".
- No dual axes.
